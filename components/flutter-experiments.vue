                <h2>Flutter Experiments</h2>
                <p>
                    When I first tried
                    <strong>Flutter</strong> I was a bit sceptical. Having logic, structure and styling all in the same place
                    doesnâ€™t make much sense for web developers.
                    But I fell in love with it after the results I archived.
                    <br><br>

                    I tried many times to get into native development, but it wasn't fun at all so I have always dropped it. 
                    Flutter makes it so much fun to develop. It's quicker, more productive and I feel like I can do anything with it.
                    <br>
                    I still have a long path to go but in the near future I hope to be working a lot with Flutter.
                    <br />
                    <br />Now I like to go to
                    <strong>Dribbble</strong> and choose a nice app design and challenge myself
                    with the task of making it real. Below you will find some of the ideias I found there and also
                    some personal projects that I put together while trying Flutter.
